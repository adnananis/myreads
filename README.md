# Project Summary
MyReads is a React-based book tracking web application that lets users organize their personal library into three shelves: "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Read." It includes a search feature to find and add new books from a predefined API, with changes persisted via backend updates. The app is built as a single-page application using React Router for navigation.
